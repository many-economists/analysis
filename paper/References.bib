	abstract = {In this paper, we give a short history of our field trial experiment in applied econometrics and outline the aims of the experiment. We discuss features of our experimental design, and judge to what extent our design was successful. The difficulties of such an experiment are acknowledged. The issue of tacit knowledge in applied econometrics is raised as a problem for further research.},

@article{sarafoglou2024subjective,
	abstract = { Many-analysts studies explore how well an empirical claim withstands plausible alternative analyses of the same dataset by multiple, independent analysis teams. Conclusions from these studies typically rely on a single outcome metric (e.g. effect size) provided by each analysis team. Although informative about the range of plausible effects in a dataset, a single effect size from each team does not provide a complete, nuanced understanding of how analysis choices are related to the outcome. We used the Delphi consensus technique with input from 37 experts to develop an 18-item subjective evidence evaluation survey (SEES) to evaluate how each analysis team views the methodological appropriateness of the research design and the strength of evidence for the hypothesis. We illustrate the usefulness of the SEES in providing richer evidence assessment with pilot data from a previous many-analysts study. },
