## Researcher Degrees of Freedom

the concept\
the entire research pipeline\

## Many-Analyst Studies

background\
small N\
focus on finding variaiton, not explaining it

## The Many-Economists Study

Goal: asking why we differ?\
Approach: do the same replication many times, changing the setting\
Suspected sources: differences over concept of research question, differences in research design, data cleaning, peer interaction\
And what we won't get at: modeling and estimation differences, errors, \
Metrics for comparison: effect size, sign and rejection, sample size, treated and control group sizes, estimation approach\
Not today: use of weights, selection of controls, sample selection choices, qualitative explanations of behavior, potential errors in treatment group definition, language used

## Design

The different stages

## The Replication Task

DACA

## Recruitment and Attrition

recruitment procedures

sample size, attrition

## Recruitment and Attrition

Descriptives: who is most likely to leave

All further analyses use only the balanced sample

## Analysis

Basic idea: descriptives of the differences between people, and how they differ (a) through stages, (b) across groups, and (c) based on peer review assignment

Report spread as variance, IQR, and for effect sizes pos/neg/sig/not, and variance weighted by inverse SE, by standard meta-analytic practice

## Effect Sizes

Effect sizes across main stages

Show full distribution, ordered CIs, and spread summary statistics

Including peer-effect revisions (and number of revisions)

## Peer Review

Show change in overall variance from stage to stage, and also show whether peer review pairs become more similar after their review (abs. difference in effect)

Also see whether stage-to-stage variance is different between those assigned to peer review *at all* vs those who weren't

## Sample Sizes

Repeat the effect size analyses, except the ones requiring a standard error

## Analytic Choices

Show distribution of e.g. logit/linear, standard error adjustments across stages

## Researcher Characteristics

Not really powered!

Calculate absolute difference from mean of effect size and also sample size. Regress abs difference on different researcher characteristics one at a time

## Conclusion

Where did we seem to see increasing agreement?

What changes in practice would make research results more consistent?

Do we want consistency?
